# python_azure_function_step_3

In Step 3, I add Azure Blob Triggers and Storage to the existing [HTTP triggered, Python based Azure Function](https://github.com/sjondavey/python_azure_function_step_2) applying techniques from Microsoft's documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-add-output-binding-storage-queue-vs-code?pivots=programming-language-python), [and here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/tutorial-vs-code-serverless-python-07). The first part will focus on using Azure and the second part will use [Azurite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite) for local development and testing of the Blog trigger.

### Add Blob Trigger Endpoints
It is easier to start with the Azure Development (as opposed to local development using the Azurite storage emulator) which means starting with a clean copy of the code from Step 2 and 


**Gotcha No 1: Import Statements** [You can read the official documentation here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference-python#import-behavior). The implication for working with an existing project is quite profound. To get this to work will mean moving the existing 'library' code into an intermediate folder. That will mean changes to all absolute import statements in the library and changes to the import statements in the tests.

Using the Azure Extension in VSCode, select the `Create a new project` icon. Choose: Current directory, language = Python; HTTP trigger; function name I used is 'simulateEquityPortfolio'; Anonymous Authorization.

**Note:** 
1. At this stage there is no blob storage. We will run this as an HTTP trigger function and output the PFE.
2. Anonymous Authorization means this will be out 'in the wild' anyone can call it. Because there are people who 'just like to watch stuff burn' you should not leave your function exposed like this in Azure for any extended time. If the wrong person finds it and just decided to call it a lot, you could end up with a hefty bill. Since the chance this happens during dev and testing is small, I think it's fine for this stage.

Now the Azure Extension is going to work its mojo. In particular it will ask to overwrite `requirements.txt` and `.gitignore`. Let it do this, we can fix this afterwards. By default the content of the new `requirements.txt` were not added to the projects virtual environment and we need to do this manually from the terminal window: `pip install azure-functions`. After this, regenerate the requirements with `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to get back all the packages used in the original project.


The project now looks like:
```

```

### Change the default behaviour on run
 In the initial project `launch.json` was set up so that pressing `F5` would run **the file that had focus in VSCode**. The Azure extension want F5 to fun the Azure Function locally (including emulating the server environnement). To switch the functionality of `F5`, choose the Run menu on the left of VSCode (the play arrow with the little bug or `Ctrl+Shft+D`). At the top of the Run menu is a green arrow and a drop down list to toggle between the `F5` functionality. 
 
Before creating any code, you should now do a quick test to make sure you can run the `hello world` boilerplate code created by the Azure Extension. See the [Run the function locally](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-first-function-vs-code?pivots=programming-language-python#configure-your-environment) section of the Microsoft configuration documentation. 

### Change how local functions are imported
OK, so now for some really annoying work. The reason to do all this work is to ensure that we can write unit tests for the Azure Functions. If you were not going to unit test the Functions interfaces, you could stick with the current project structure and follow [this reference](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-python-worker/issues/219). 

Move the library folder `equityportfolioevolver` inside the Functions Folder `simulateEquityPortfolio`! If you followed the instructions in Step 1 and used relative imports in this library, it should still work but you will need to change all the imports in the test classes.

The project now looks like:
```
equityportfolioevolver  
├── .venv/                              # [unchanged]  
├── .vscode/                            # [unchanged content]  
├── simulateEquityPortfolio/            # Folder for everything that we will need for the Azure hooks
│   ├── equityportfolioevolver/         # [Moved]
│   │   ├── contracts/                  # [unchanged if using relative imports]
│   │   │   └── portfolio.py            # [unchanged if using relative imports]
│   │   └── rates/                      # [unchanged if using relative imports]
│   │       └── rates_evolver.py        # [unchanged if using relative imports]
│   ├── __init__.py                     # [unchanged]
│   ├── function.json                   # [unchanged]
│   └── sample.dat                      # [unchanged]
├── test/                               # [unchanged]
│   ├── test_portfolio.py               # Change imports to reflect new folder structure
│   └── test_rates_evolver.py           # Change imports to reflect new folder structure
├── .gitignore                          # [unchanged]
├── host.json                           # [unchanged]
├── proxies.json                        # [unchanged]
└── requirements.txt                    # [unchanged]
```

At this stage the `__init__.py` function can be changed to do something useful - not just the hello world example. I have also included some intermediate functionality in a file `stock_forwards_mc.py` to test that I can reference all types of files from all locations, including the test folder. In addition, I have changed the function to run in `__init__.py` from `main` to `simulate`. In order to get the new entry point registered the line `"entryPoint"` needs to be included in `function.json`
```python
{
  "scriptFile": "__init__.py",
  "entryPoint": "simulate",
  "bindings": [
   ...
```
With these changes, the Azure Function can be run locally. A call to this function is made from the web browser as 
```
http://localhost:7071/api/simulateEquityPortfolio?isin=something&long_short=long&volume=1000&strike=16.7&ttm=1.57
```

When you look at `__init__.py` you will see that it is also possible to pass the Function a JSON input. I was able to use [Postman](https://www.postman.com) to hit this part of the API call. In Postman a call can be sent passing the 
1. Parameters: Get call with the Params populated as key = isin; value = some_isin ...
2. JSON: POST message with Call with header / Content-Type set to application / json and then Body set to raw with the input
```
{"forwards":[
            {'isin': 'isin_1', 'long_short': 'long', 'volume': 1000, 'strike': 16.4, 'ttm': 1.52},
            {'isin': 'isin_2', 'long_short': 'short', 'volume': 500, 'strike': 12.3, 'ttm': 0.98}
            ]}
```
[See here for some documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-manually-run-non-http) which helped me get the JSON message working.

Finally he two test files `test_simulate_stock_portfolio.py` and `test_single_stock_mc.py` are added to the testing folder. The former shows how to construct HTTP Requests to test calls to the function using parameters and using a JSON body.
